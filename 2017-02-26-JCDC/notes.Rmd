* We don't really know how many species are there? Yet, it's the basic unit for
  conservation and to understand change
* Another critical aspect is that we don't know enough about the distribution of
  species, and it's probably one of the most important parameter that will be
  affected with global change
* What can we do?
* Metabarcoding:
  - description of the approach
  - tell us how many species
  - tell us where they are distributed
  - but species names critical to use historical knowledge, natural history,
    predicting traits that are sensitive to global change
  - tell us the proportion of species we don't know about
* Project design:
  - sampling plankton because all/most species reproduce through larval stage
  - groundtruthing metabarcoding with individually barcoding larvae
  - no metabarcoding data yet
  - larva data
* Larva data
  - How many larvae
  - Map of where the larvae come from
  - How many species, breakdown per phylum
  - Proportion of larvae with matches in public databases
  - What does this number mean?
    + is it high? low?
	+ are some of the groups over or under represented?
* If we knew all the species that live in the sea, or even the number of species
  that lived at the Whitney lab, we could look at how many of the species have
  been barcoded, and we would get the answer to this question. Instead we only
  have access to partial sources of information:
  - list of species that occur in an area (expert lists)
  - list of species based on museum specimens
  - list of described species
  - list of barcoded species
* In the past, it was difficult to summarize and synthesize this information
  because it was disparate, scattered among institutions, ... Here first attempt
  to summarize this information
* Expert list
  - How much of it is in museum collections?
  - How much of it has been barcoded?
* What is in museum collections?
  - map of sampling effort
  - map of diversity
  - how much of it has been barcoded?
* How can we use this knowledge to assess how much (or rather how little we know
  about biodiversity)?
  - we need more sampling
	+ correlation between number of samples and diversity
	+ knowledge through time plots
  - we can use the information to identify taxonomic groups that deserve more
    attention
  - but we need to be careful because this is based on current knowledge and
    some of it probably grossly underestimate how little we know about some
    groups (check out the hemichordate paper)
* Compare species in iDigBio and proportion of what I have matched in my
  barcodes?
  - sampling the plankton is probably a reasonable approach to estimate diversity of an area
  - compare with other meta-barcoding studies, what's the proportion of species
    with no match?
  - re-analyze the data by taxonomic groups/family to see which groups are
    closer/further from estimates based on what we know about total diversity
  - to do that we need better tools to estimate closest match --> we got funding
    to do that!
