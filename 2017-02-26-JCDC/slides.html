# We don't know enough about biodiversity

### How many species?

# We don't know enough about biodiversity

### How many species?
### Where do species live?

### Questions:

- What is the impact of pollution, perturbations?
- Which species are invasive?
- How does global change affect communities?

### What can it tell us?

* Species delineation, speeds up taxonomy
* Works on all stages of the life cycle
* Associated with museum specimens and photographs

# What can we do?

## Metabarcoding


.pull-left[

### What can it tell us?

* Number of species
* Where are the species distributed?
* Applicable to many types of environmental samples
* **Well-suited for monitoring**

### Pre-requisites

* Comprehensive and accurate databases
* Need to ground truth the results

# Questions

## Which species live in the area?

--

## How well do we know the fauna?


---

# Project design

## Plankton sampling

- Capture in a single habitat a diversity of species
- Bi-monthly sampling for a year
- Document larval stages of local species

--

## DNA barcoding on individual larvae

--

## Metabarcoding on full plankton tows

---

# How many species?

# Known diversity

- Number of known species found in the plankton: 62 (out of 253)
- Breakdown by phylum (0 match for Platyhelminthes, Phoronida, Acoelomorpha):

# How to interpret these numbers?

---

# How to interpret these numbers?

### If only we knew the total number of species...

### Instead we have:

* Expert faunistic lists

  - most comprehensive, limited in geographic scope

--

* Museum specimens

  - can be validated, not everything digitized

--

* Described species

  - almost complete, only captures described species

--

* Species occurences

  - good for species ranges, difficult to validate

---

# How to interpert these numbers?

### Instead we have:

* Expert faunistic lists

* Museum specimens ⟶ **iDigBio**

* Described species ⟶ **WoRMS**

* Species occurences ⟶ **GBIF, OBIS**

--

### **First synthesis of knowledge for marine invertebrates**

* How much of what we know is captured in these databases?

* How much do we know?

* What should we do next?

# Expert lists




* Kozloff's "Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest"

  - 2705 species

* Felder and Camp's "Gulf of Mexico Origin, Waters, and Biota"

  - 8570 species

# Proportion barcoded

# Recommendations

* More sampling

  - Proportion of species known from a single specimen: 27.2%
  - Proportion of species known from less than 5 specimens: 59.5%
  - Proprotion of species not collected since 1980: 41.2%
  - Number of species added:
      + between 1960 and 1970: 1163
	  + since 2000: 498
  - Need more information about small phyla

--

* Use metabarcoding and existing data to inform future sampling effort

--

* Improve bioinformatics tools to get better species assignment of not barcoded
