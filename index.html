  With over 7 years of professional experience in non-profits and startups, I am
  a leader and solution engineer in data science who bridges the gap between
  complex technical challenges and business needs. My expertise spans 20+ years
  of R programming, data pipeline development, and creation of web applications
  with Shiny, complemented by a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Florida.
  I've led the creation of widely-used data science educational content, driven
  product adoption through innovative marketing strategies, and spearheaded
  compliance efforts, demonstrating my ability to manage cross-functional,
  high-impact projects.
