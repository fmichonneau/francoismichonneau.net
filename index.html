<p><a href="https://carpentries.org">The Carpentries</a> is a global
organization and inclusive community that teaches foundational coding and data
science skills to researchers. As the Senior Director of Technology for this
organization, I oversee the development of the infrastructure we rely on to
organize our workshops, train our instructors, and coordinate the development of
our lessons.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau">develop open-source software</a>
in R and I have authored several packages to analyze biodiversity and
phylogenetic data. I enjoy writing web applications
using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny</a> and I love teaching
beginners how to use the <a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a> to
  wrangle and visualize their data. I am a certified <a href="https://carpentries.org/instructors/">Instructor</a> and <a href="https://carpentries.org/trainers/">Trainer</a> with The Carpentries and a <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/michonneau+francois/">Certified RStudio Instructor</a>.</p>

<p>Before joining The Carpentries, I was studying marine biodiversity at the
University of Florida and the Florida Museum of Natural History. For my PhD, I
investigated species limits and cryptic diversity in <a href="{{
site.baseurl}}/photos/holothuroidea/">sea cucumbers</a>, and conducted a
taxonomic revision of a genus of small sea cucumbers. </p>
