<p>My research interests are centered around understanding the origin, maintenance,
and distribution of biodiversity. I am interested to understand how diversity is
generated, how species are related to each others, and how ecological and
historical factors shape the geographic distribution of diversity. To address
these questions, I use integrative approaches combining molecular and
morphological data, modern statistical and computing tools.</p>

<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Whitney Laboratory for Marine
Bioscience at the University of Florida, where I document the diversity of
planktonic communities using meta-barcoding. For my PhD, I investigated species
limits and cryptic diversity in sea cucumbers, and conducted a taxonomic
revision of a genus of small sea cucumbers. In addition to my research, I
develop open-source software for biodiversity data, and the analysis of
phylogenetic data in R.</p>

<p>Because I believe that science would progress faster if more scientists knew
basic programming skills, I developed my own programming course for graduate
students (<a href="http://r-bio.github.io">R programming for biologists</a>). As
a certified instructor and an active member of
the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>
and <a href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> organizations, I have
been invited to teach programming workshops in the US and in Europe.</p>
