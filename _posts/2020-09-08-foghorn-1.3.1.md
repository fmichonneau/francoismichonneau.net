---


A new version of [`foghorn`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foghorn)
(version 1.3.1) was just accepted on CRAN.

`foghorn` is an R package that allows you to:
- browse the results of the CRAN checks on your package (with `cran_results()`
  and `cran_details()`);
- check where your package stands when submitted to CRAN (with
  `cran_incoming()`);
- and starting with version 1.3.1, check whether your package is in the Win
  builder queue (with `winbuilder_queue()`).
  
The idea of inspecting the Win-builder queue [was proposed](https://github.com/fmichonneau/foghorn/issues/40) by
Kirill MÃ¼ller.

If you would like to start using `foghorn`, check out the
[vignette](https://fmichonneau.github.io/foghorn/articles/foghorn.html) that
comes with the package.

[Feedback and suggestions](https://github.com/fmichonneau/foghorn/issues/new) for `foghorn` are welcome!
