<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib" title="BEAGLE website" target="_blank">BEAGLE</a> is a library that computes efficiently the likelihoods needed during maximum-likelihood or Bayesian phylogenetic tree estimation. It is used by MrBayes, Garli, PhyML and BEAST.</p>
<p>If you are using BEAST on a modern computer, you want to use BEAGLE to take advantage of the many cores of your CPU. It will greatly speed up your analytical time. BEAGLE can also be used to take advantage of your GPU (the processor on your graphic card) but I'm not going to talk about this here.</p>
<p>There are some installation instructions on the BEAGLE website but, at least with my setup it is not quite enough to make it work with BEAST with my setup (ubuntu 14.04, BEAST 1.8.0 and BEAST 2.1.2).</p>
<p>First, you need to get the necessary dependencies:</p>
<p>[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake \<br />
  libtool subversion pkg-config openjdk-7-jdk<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Second, you need to compile and install the library:</p>
<p>Download the latest version of BEAGLE using subversion:<br />
[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
svn checkout http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \<br />
   beagle-lib<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Go to the directory and run the <code>autogen.sh</code> script:<br />
[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
cd beagle-lib<br />
./autogen.sh<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Run <code>configure</code>. On the BEAGLE website, the author advise to install BEAGLE in your home directory, but that makes things more complicated down the road. If you have root privileges, install it directly where it should go in <code>/usr/local</code>.<br />
[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
./configure --prefix=/usr/local<br />
sudo make install<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>At the end of configure, you will get warnings indicating that the openCL and CUDA libraries were not found and will not be used. Unless you want to use your GPU this is not a problem. If you want to use your GPU you can specify the path of the libraries with the arguments <code>--with-opencl=</code> and <code>--with-cuda=</code>. If you can find recent packaged (installed with apt-get) versions of these libraries that work for your GPU, they will be installed in <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/</code> (on a 64-bit architecture), so you would need to use: <code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-opencl=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code>.</p>
<p>To make sure that the installation was successful, run the checks provided with BEAGLE (this should still be run in the <code>beagle-lib</code> directory):<br />
[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
make check<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>You should see the tests being passed:<br />
[code gutter="false"]<br />
=========================================<br />
Testsuite summary for libhmsbeagle 2.1.2<br />
=========================================<br />
# TOTAL: 1<br />
# PASS:  1<br />
# SKIP:  0<br />
# XFAIL: 0<br />
# FAIL:  0<br />
# XPASS: 0<br />
# ERROR: 0<br />
=========================================<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>If all goes well, you can now check that BEAST can use BEAGLE by typing:</p>
<p>[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
./beast -beagle_info<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>which should show something like this:<br />
[code gutter="false"]<br />
Using BEAGLE library v2.1.2 for accelerated, parallel likelihood evaluation<br />

Citation: Ayres et al (2012) Systematic Biology 61: 170-173 | doi:10.1093/sysbio/syr100</p>

[/code]</p>
<p>So next time you can use some or all of the cores (in the example below 8) of your CPU when running BEAST with the options:</p>
<p>[code lang="bash" gutter="false"]<br />
./beast -beagle -beagle_SSE -threads 8 input.xml<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>If you don't have root privileges and need to install BEAGLE somewhere else (let's say your home directory using <code>./configure --prefix=$HOME</code>), then you need to edit the <code>beast</code> executable to include this path in the <code>java.library.path</code>. In our example the library will be installed in <code>$HOME/lib</code>, which means that in the executable, this <code>-Djava.library.path="$BEAST_LIB:/usr/local/lib"</code> needs to be changed to <code>-Djava.library.path="$BEAST_LIB:/usr/local/lib:$HOME/lib"</code>. Otherwise, you are going to see this message:<br />
[code gutter="false"]<br />
Failed to load BEAGLE library: no hmsbeagle-jni in java.library.path<br />
BEAGLE not installed/found<br />
[/code]<br />
when trying to use BEAGLE with BEAST.</p>
