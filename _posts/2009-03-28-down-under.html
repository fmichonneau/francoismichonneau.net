<p>I started the year in summer as I was in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>First, I participated to the 13<sup>th</sup> International Echinoderm Conference in Hobart, Tasmania. I presented there the latest results on the sea cucumber tree and a poster on the genus <i>Euapta</i>.</p>
<p>I then made my way north through the major museums of natural history of the East coast (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane) to look for some treasures in their holothurian collections.</p>
<p>Finally, I joined the CReefs expedition in Lizard Island to collect sea cucumbers and other marine invertebrates. You can learn more by reading the <a href="http://www.aims.gov.au/creefs/latest-field-trip.html">blog</a> of this trip written by Angus Livingston.</p>
