I wrote a tutorial to get started using GMYC (the Generalized Mixed Yule
Coalescent). GMYC is a popular method for species delineation based on a single
locus. GMYC is fast, easy to use, and relatively accurate.

This tutorial uses data from one of my research projects that investigates how
the number of esimated species is affected by the choice of the priors used when
using a tree inferred with BEAST. It is currently available as a pre-print.
