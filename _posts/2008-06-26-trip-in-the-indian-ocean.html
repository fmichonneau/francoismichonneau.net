<p>Tim Werner (University of Boston) wrote a <a href="http://www.neaq.org/education_and_activities/blogs_webcams_videos_and_more/blogs/sea_cucumber_blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> for our recent expedition in Nosy Bé (Madagascar).</p>
<p>After this trip to Madagascar, Arthur Anker and I spent two weeks in Mayotte. We didn't collect as heavily as we did in Madagascar but we found some interesting species. For sea cucumbers, all the big species that were very rare or absent in Nosy Bé, were relatively easy to find on Mayotte's reefs.</p>
<p>Now I am preparing for <a href="http://www.nova.edu/ncri/11icrs/">ICRS</a>...</p>
