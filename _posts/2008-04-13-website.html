<p>I decided to start a website to talk about my research and about the organisms I study for my PhD: the sea cucumbers. In addition of the things usually found on a research website (CV, publications,etc), you will be able to get the latest news about sea cucumbers. You will also find a description of the open-source projects I am involved in. Some pretty pictures will also be available.</p>
