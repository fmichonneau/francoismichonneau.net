To keep you entertained about invertebrates when we are not in the field, I will
write regularly about invertebrates that made the news recently. On the menu
today: a summary of a story published today about rotifers and a video of a tiny
sea anemone.

# How do bdelloid rotifers do without sex?

There are less than 1% of all animal species that don't use sex at all to
reproduce. And, for most of them it seems that they gave it up fairly
recently. This suggests that, in the long run, species that do not use sex to
reproduce end up extinct. By not reproducing sexually, species accumulate
deleterious mutations, and cannot exchange mutations that could help them to
adapt to changes in their environment -- such as new diseases.


Bdelloid rotifers are an exception, as it seems that they have been reproducing
strictly asexually for tens of millions of years. A study published today in the
journal <i>Science</i> by Wilson & Sherman sheds some light on the cause of this
exception.

Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic animals that live in any kind of moist habitat
all around the globe. In addition to their mode of reproduction, bdelloid
rotifers are also exceptional in their ability to stay alive out of the water
for up to 9 years (at any of their life stages). This ability might be one of
the factors explaining why they do well without sex.

The authors of the study showed that staying out of the water for a few weeks
reduced drastically the number of individuals killed by a pathogenic fungus. By
staying dry for an extended period of time, they can get rid of the the fungus
and reduce the selective pressure that these pathogens impose to these asexual
rotifers.

# Video of <i>Corynactis viridis</i>

Have a look at this video of this small sea anemone feeding on plankton. Note
how it can change the shape of its tentacles and its mouth (in the center). This
video has been filmed under fluorescent light and is played 1200 times faster.
