<p>I devote part of my research to the development of tools for managing and analyzing biodiversity data and phylogenetic information.</p>

<h2>rotl</h2>
<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/rotl/">rotl</a></code> provides an interface to the <a href="http://tree.opentreeoflife.org/">Open Tree of Life</a> data. <code>rotl</code> makes it easy to have in memory a phylogenetic tree for a given subset of species, or trees from published studies that are stored in Open Tree.</p>

<h2>rncl</h2>
<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/rncl/">rncl</a></code> provides
  an interface to the NEXUS Class Library to import in R the content of NEXUS
  and Newick files.</p>

<h2>phylobase</h2>
<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/phylobase/">phylobase</a></code> provides functions and methods to handle phylogenetic trees and associated data. It aims to provide a common toolkit to manipulate phylogenetic data in R. Developers can focus on new methods rather than re-coding basic functions, while end-users do not need to re-learn the functions.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to send comments or suggestions by
  opening <a href="https://github.com/phylobase/issues/new">an issue on
  GitHub</a> or by getting in touch on the
  developer <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/phylobase-devl">mailing
  list</a>.</p>
