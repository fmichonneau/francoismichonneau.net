<p>My research interests are centered around understanding the origin, maintenance, and distribution of biodiversity. I am interested to understand how diversity is generated, how species are related to each others, and how ecological and historical factors shape the geographic distribution of diversity. To address these questions, I use integrative approaches combining molecular and morphological data, modern statistical and computing tools.</p>
<p>During my PhD at the University of Florida, I investigated species limits and cryptic diversity in sea cucumbers, and conducted a taxonomic revision of a genus of small sea cucumbers. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience where I document the diversity of planktonic communities using meta-barcoding. I am involved in<br />
for <a href="http://idigbio.org">iDigBio</a> where I am facilitating the use of biodiversity through better data management practices, and data analysis training. In complement to my research, I develop open-source software for biodiversity data, and the analysis of phylogenetic data in R. Because, I believe that science would progress faster if more scientists knew basic programming skills, I developed my own programming course for graduate students (<a href="http://r-bio.github.io/">R programming for biologists</a>). As a certified instructor and an active member of the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> organizations, I have organized and taught programming workshops in the US and in Europe.</p>
