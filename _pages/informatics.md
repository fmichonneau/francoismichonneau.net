## Scientific Software

I devote part of my research to the development of tools for managing and
analyzing biodiversity data and phylogenetic information.

### rotl

<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/rotl/">rotl</a></code> provides an interface to the data from <a href="http://tree.opentreeoflife.org/">Open Tree of Life</a> project. <code>rotl</code> makes it easy to have in memory a phylogenetic tree for a given subset of species, or trees from published studies that are stored in Open Tree.</p>

If you use `rotl` please cite
our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12593)

### rncl

<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/rncl/">rncl</a></code> provides
  an interface to the NEXUS Class Library to import in R the content of
  phylogenetic trees stored in NEXUS and Newick files.</p>

### phylobase

<p><code><a href="https://github.com/fmichonneau/phylobase/">phylobase</a></code> provides functions and methods to handle phylogenetic trees and associated data. It aims to provide a common toolkit to manipulate phylogenetic data in R. Developers can focus on new methods rather than re-coding basic functions, while end-users do not need to re-learn the functions.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to send comments or suggestions by
  opening <a href="https://github.com/phylobase/issues/new">an issue on
  GitHub</a> or by getting in touch on the
  developer <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/phylobase-devl">mailing
  list</a>.</p>

## Other Software

### riceware

[`riceware`](https://github.com/fmichonneau/riceware) provides an implementation
of the Diceware method for strong password generation.

### foghorn

[`foghorn`](https://github.com/fmichonneau/foghorn) gives access to the results
of the CRAN check results directly in your R terminal.
