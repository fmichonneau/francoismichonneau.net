## Leadership Skills

### Customer Success, Product Education, Curriculum Development

* **Customer Success:** At Voltron Data, I was part of the Customer Success team
  and participated in pre- and post-sales calls. I liaised with the product and
  engineering teams to escalate issues and feedback from the customers. I also
  led the creation and delivery of webinars and workshops for customers and AEs
  about Voltron Data's products and the open source solutions they support.
* **Product Education:** I collaborated with the Marketing and Engineering teams
  to an [online book](https://voltrondata.com/codex) that describes the
  principles of modular data systems. This 5-chapter online book and its
  associated marketing campaign drove trafic to the main website by 50%. I also
  contributed many blog posts (some examples [^1] [^2] [^3]) and
  [tutorials](https://ibis-project.org/tutorials/ibis-for-dplyr-users).
* **Curriculum Development:** At The Carpentries, lessons are developed
  following evidence-based principles to ensure that they are effective with
  learners. I co-wrote a lesson on curriculum design, and taught The Carpentries
  Instructor to a total of 200+ learners. I was also the author and Maintainer
  for the Data Carpentry R Ecology lesson between 2014 and 2022, one of the most
  taught lessons at The Carpentries (30k+ unique visitors a month).

### Company Culture & People Management

* **Hiring, Performance Evaluation, Management:** As a leader of the
  Infrastructure Team at The Carpentries, I had the opportunity to hire
  wonderful colleagues. I led or contributed to the hiring process of 5+
  positions (full time and contractors). I directly supervised, including
  leading their annual performance evalution, 6 people (UX/UI Designers,
  Python/Django Developers, Software Engineers) working on different technical
  projects.
* **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:** Creating a work environment where
  diversity is embraced, celebrated, and nurtured, is a thoughtful process that
  needs to be continuously evaluated and adjusted. I have contributed in
  developing work policies that champion equity and inclusion. For instance, by
  anticipating accommodations during the hiring process or by respecting
  preferred communication methods with co-workers, it creates a safer space
  where everyone can do their best work.
* **Remote Team Management:** Having colleagues across time zones with different
  constraints on their schedules, and that you only get to see in person once a
  year require implementing strategies to ensure effective communication and
  team work. Running meetings with intention, developing communication norms,
  working in the open, having processes in place for decision making are some
  examples of things I have experience implementing and that make remote work
  enjoyable and effective.


### Product and Project Management

* **GDPR compliance**. I liaised with a team of lawyers to identify changes
  needed in The Carpentries data management practices to be compliant with GDPR.
  I developed a roadmap, supervised the implementation or directly implemented
  changes needed in the infrastructure, and documented processes and policies.
* **Data management system** ([AMY](https://github.com/carpentries/amy)) 
  is an open source Django application that manages data about people, events,
  members, and lessons for The Carpentries. For about 2 years, I worked with
  contractors to roadmap features, develop their specifications, review and test
  code changes. Most of these features were related to implementing data
  management practices for GDPR compliance.
* **Lesson Infrastructure** Since the beginning of volunteering with The
  Carpentries in 2014, I started to contribute to the lesson template. These
  contributions gave me a chance to understand what was difficult for newcomers
  to contribute content to the lessons or to use the template for their own
  lessons. I started to develop a vision and a roadmap to implement a new system
  based on RMarkdown and GitHub Actions to lower the technical barriers to
  contribute to Carpentries lessons. I wrote grant proposals that were funded by
  the [R
  consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2018-group-1#developing+tools+and+templates+for+teaching+materials)
  (2018) and [CZI](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/czi-moore-grant/)
  (2019). I managed [Zhian Kamvar](https://zkamvar.netlify.app/about/) who
  developed my initial vision into an amazing, fully functional, product: [The
  Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).
* **Grants and Academic Publications** Both during my time in academia and at
  The Carpentries, I managed the budget, the deliverables, and reporting
  associated with grant funding. During my time in academia, I authored and
  co-authored [20+ scientific
  publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=6wJ8BtAAAAAJ),
  including the description of [a new species of sea cucumber]({% post_url
  2014-01-31-phyrella-revision %}) which was featured on [Boing
  Boing](https://boingboing.net/2014/02/11/sea-cucumber-named-for-dog.html).

## Technical Skills

### Programming and Data Analysis

* **R**: I am the most familiar with the R programming language. I started using
  it in 2004, and never stopped.
  - For data analysis and visualization, I have extensive experience with all
    the packages of the `{tidyverse}` (`{dplyr}`, `{ggplot2}`, `{purrr}`,
    `{tidyr}`, etc.). I have the Tidyverse Trainer certification from RStudio
    (now Posit) and was an Examiner for this certification for a couple of
    years. On the statistical side, I have experience with linear models
    (including GLMs) and Bayesian statistics.
  - On the programming side, I maintain 6 packages on CRAN. I enjoy developing
    solutions that interact with Web APIs or scrape web pages. For instance, my
    most popular packages are:
    + [`{foghorn}`](https://fmichonneau.github.io/foghorn/) which brings CRAN
      check results directly to your terminal (50K downloads/month).
    + [`{rotl}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rotl/) which uses the OpenTree of
      Life web API to R (used in 370+ peer-reviewed publications).
    + [`naturalist_bot`](https://botsin.space/naturalist_bot) is a Mastodon bot
      that posts iNaturalist observations every 6 hours.
  - I have extensive experience putting R scripts and Shiny applications in
    production using Docker (and Docker compose), and deploying them on AWS.
* **Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions:** I use Git and GitHub to version control my
  code (and many other documents). I use GitHub Actions for continuous
  integration, running cron jobs, checking website links, and posting for my
  Mastodon bot.
* **Databases:** I have used PostgreSQL (with the PostGIS extension) to manage
  data for research projects and in enterprise settings. More recently, I have
  started to use DuckDB to analyze large and complex datasets. At Voltron Data,
  I had the opportunity to learn about and use Apache Arrow (using both the
  Python and the R bindings).

### DevOps and DataOps

* **Linux/Ubuntu**: I have been using Ubuntu as my daily operating system since
  2006, and on any cloud instance I have ever created. My sysadmin knowledge is
  all self-taught and I know where to look when something goes wrong to diagnose
  an issue and find a solution.
* **Cloud Providers (AWS, Digital Ocean)**: I have most experience with AWS and
  Digital Ocean but I have also used Google Cloud. With AWS, I set up the
  technical infrastructure of The Carpentries to run on EC2 and S3 (static site
  hosting and backups), used Route53 to manage domains, and RDS to manage
  databases.
* **Docker**: I developed several web apps coded in R and Shiny that I bundled
  with Docker Compose to make it easy to maintain and deploy. These applications
  typically also used Let's Encrypt to manage the SSL certificates, and Redis to
  cache remote data.
* **Data Pipelines**: For one of my most complex research projects, I developed
  a data processing pipeline that fetches millions of records from multiple
  biodiversity public repositories, reconciliate them and their associated
  species names, before analyzing them. I wrote this type of pipeline in R using
  the `{remake}` package and PostgreSQL. I have started to revisit this project
  to use tools that are better suited but didn't exist when I started this
  project: `{targets}` and DuckDB.
* **Database connectors**: During my tenure at Voltron Data, I had the
  opportunity to learn about and use in benchmarking tests the different
  database connectivity protocols such as ODBC, JDBC, and ADBC.

  changing ideas, circumstances, contexts- and he takes it all in stride. He
  seems unshakeable sometimes!"

> "His work is always comprehensive and he takes time to ensure people can
  understand the subject matter."

> "François is a fantastic collaborator; he can explain complex technical
  concepts to novices and oversee projects and programs while providing team
  members with the flexibility to fulfill their roles."

> "When François is leading, his guidance is so very clear and he has an
  attention to detail that does not leave room for misunderstanding. This can be
  very helpful in brainstorming sessions to create a safe and engaging space for
