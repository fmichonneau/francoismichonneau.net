## What others have said about working with me

> "François' greatest strength is his adaptivity. He often has to adapt to
  changing ideas, circumstances, contexts- and he takes it all in stride. He
  seems unshakeable sometimes!"

> "His work is always comprehensive and he takes time to ensure people can
  understand the subject matter."

> "François is a fantastic collaborator; he can explain complex technical
  concepts to novices and oversee projects and programs while providing team
  members with the flexibility to fulfill their roles."

> "When François is leading, his guidance is so very clear and he has an
  attention to detail that does not leave room for misunderstanding. This can be
  very helpful in brainstorming sessions to create a safe and engaging space for
